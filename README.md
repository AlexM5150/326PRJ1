For compiling we used the terminal enviroment to run the files first using the cd command to get into the local directory where our files were located.
Then we ran both files in seperate terminals using the javac command followed by the java filename ex: javac QuoteServer.java
Then we opened the server using the java command followed by the filename ex: java QuoteServer
Then we ran the client file using the java command followed by the filename ex: java QuoteClient
For the first question it simply outputted the quote of the day.
The second question then prompted the client to input a string ex: Hi Server im Client
Then the server would respond with an echo ex: Hi Client im Server
Then after the client closes the connection the program ends.
